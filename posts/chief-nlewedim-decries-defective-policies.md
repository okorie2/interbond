DEFECTIVE policies and lack of will on the part of the economic
managers have been blamed for the non realisation of our
industrialisation dreams.Added to the above is the non - involvement
of investors in policy formulation as it concerns the productive sub-sector of the economy.

Chief Sonny Nlewedim, a foremost industrialist and chief.executive
of Interbond Nigeria Limited stated this in a discussion on the
state of the economy at the weekend.

Chief Nlewedim took a swipe on the policy formulators who arrogate to themselves absolute
knowledge of a terrain they are not practically engaged in This
results in the formulation of text book policies that are a far cry
from the realities on the ground and naturally, such policies are
ineffective as the for naturally, such policies are ineffective as
the formulators are ill - informed ", he stressed.

As long as our industrialization policies are formulated without due
difference to the inputs from the actual investors, we would end
drawing up policies for the shelves and archives, he further argued.
Chief Nlewedim reasoned that in a situation of poor infastructural
base, capital fight, an exchange rate that skews unfavourably
against the naira and an unsensitised market, no reasonable investor
would put down money in any manufacturing business in nigeria.
