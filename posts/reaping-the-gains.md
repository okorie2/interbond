Internationally renowned economist, Professor Adam Smith, in his popular book, “the wealth of Nations”, spoke extensively on the politics of demand and supply in the marketing goods and services. For instance, he posts that the market orientation of individual goods and services necessarily makes them to be admired and purchased by willing customers

This marketability phenomenon could also apply to individual businessmen and politics for an ideal competition-whether for political power and economic gain, the market value of individuals often tend to decide how they succeed or fail in the endeavor. An intellectually, morally and physically dislocated individual will often be seen as a taboo in economic or political market. In business life, the key phrases are courage and determination of these and personal charisma, should ideally make one to succeed and tower above all others who lack in them.

This could be true of Chief Sonny Nlewedim, the flamboyant Chairman and Chief Executive of Interbond Nigeria Ltd and Interbond Finance and Securities Ltd.

In his early forties Chief Nlewedim has displayed a rare business acumen and investment wisdom by daring to invest in an economy that is as perilous and unpredictable as it is gloomy. It was indeed his sheer sense of patriotism and theurge to take up challenges that drove him to the top where he is today comfortably seated.

Chief Sonny Nlewedim, whose research saw wisdom in adding glamor in lighting and lamps manufacturing and marketing, started first with the importation of electrical chandeliers and later went into its local manufacturing in partnership with foreign associates. Within a short period, his company is today able to capture a large sector of the market which it is determined to completely take over. His strong advocacy for industrialization of the nation's economy through private sector effort over the years has encouraged our youths to adopt the production of goods and services as a necessary step to economic development and to give them a push, Chief Nlewedim was chosen last year as one of the investors that performed creditably in championing the economic vista of Nigeria in acknowledgement of the place of the private sector effort in the nation's economic rejuvenation.

An epitome of success Chief Sonny Nlewedim even at first sight looks successful, smells success and in fact dresses successfully too with his looks and elegance, coupled with the confidence he exudes in discussing about industrialization and economy, the Interbond Group Chairman and Chief Executive would only have the sky as his limit to greater achievements.

For even in terms of competence and good mission, his ability of effectively managing human resource element of Interbond Group and other factors of production, clearly stand him in good stead
