Finance institutions have been urged to fund projects that will accelerate the desired industrial take off the country.

Abia state Governor, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu made the plea in Umuahia on Tuesday at the commissioning of the head office complex of the inter-bond finance and securities limited (IFS). He was represented at the formal opening of the indigenous firm by his deputy, Dr Chima Nwafor. The governor said that funding of such projects can no longer be left to the conventioned banks governments and its agencies

He noted, though the country has abundant skilled man power for industrial takeoff, what was needed is the capital resources and monetization processes to harness the available human capabilities. Finance houses Dr Onu stated, should provide the capital base and ensure credit liberalization to enable crucial industrial project take off.

The governor expressed delight that the management of interbond finance and securities braved all odds to become the first indigenous finance outfit to provide the incentives for the industrial take off of the states. IFS is one of the few finance houses to have its head office outside Lagos.

The chairman of that company, Chief Sunny Nlewedim explained the genuine desire of the organization to propel the private sectors towards the funding of economic activities in the country.

He stated that the company was aware that traditional banking institution could no longer meet the growing capital requirements of perspective investors. The iron and steel senior staff association of Nigeria said in Benin of Wednesday that the closure of Delta steel complex in Aladia, a major source of raw material for the rolling mills at Jos, Katsina and Oshogbo, was an attempt to destroy the company and frustrate industrialization in the country.
