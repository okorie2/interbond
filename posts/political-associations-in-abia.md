If these last four groups merge to become one in future, according to the sources they are going to give the ANC in the state a good fight as the latter is seen as being centered round an individual.

Moreover, both the NUC, PDA, CNC, NCN and, NPM have proclaimed themselves in Abia as being progressive, and may not quarrel much over nomenclature.

Meanwhile, all the groups are mobilizing at the grassroots for the October 1 broadcast of General Sani Abacha which would unfold the expected transition program. Sources close to the NCN in abia indicated that a number of its members may already have set-up their independent machinery to contest the partyâ€™s gubernatorial seat.

Among them are a Lagos based industrialist Chief Sony Nlewedim from Umuawa, Umuahia Urban and Chief Chidi Onwumere, former sole Administrator of the Modern Ceramics Industries limited; who hails from Olokoro, the same home with Prince Vincent Eze Oghlafor of the PDA who also has the same ambition.
