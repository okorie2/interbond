It is not certain exact date when Nigerians will troop out again to
the polling booths to cast their votes to elect politicians of their
choice.What is however certain now is the underground politicking by
ambitious politicians chiming to contest elective offices.This is the
case inAbia where the battle is now intense especially in Abia
central(Umuahia Zone) or Abia South(Aba Zone) following an unwritten
agreement that the zone would produce the next governor for the
state.On parade from the zone for the governorship race are the likes
of Chief Empire Kano, Chief Ojo Maduekwe, Prince Vincent Eze
Ogbulafor, Chief Emma Ebila, Chief K.K.owen, Chief Chidi Onwumere,
Dr.Joshua Ogbonnaya, Chief Orji Kalu, and Chief Sonny Uwakwe Nlewedim.

However, Chief Sonny Uwakwe Nlewedim comered soon after be publicly
declared a gathering in Umuahia recently that he was totally in the
race for the governorship seat in Abia state.Chief Nlewedim, 42, is
a businessman from Umuahia Local Government area of the state, same
Local Government are with Chief Empire Kanu, Dr.Ogbonnaya, and Chief
Onwumere, all governorship aspirants.Infact, Chief Nlewedim and
Chief Kanu are from the same Ohuhu clan of Umuahia that produced the
late Dr.Michael Okpara, premier of the defunct Eastern Nigeria.

Chief NIewedim, a member of the National Congress of Nigeria(NGN)
explained that he was more qualified“ to shoulder the positions of
Umuahia and Abia more so as the state still lack the infastructure
for effective take - off as a new state”.He said he was not happy
that the Umuahia since 1991 has not grown the way Owerri developed
from 1976 when it became the capital of the Old Imo State " noting,
" as a Son of the soil, I know where the shoe pinches in
Umuahia”.Chief Nlewedim maintained that persons who have not had the
exposure of controlling a reasonable ownership of Means of
livelihood "may not be suitable to occupy, public office because,
people would see their first tenure in office as an opportunity to
grab as much as they could, thereby, looting public treasury”.He
however kicked against the creation of more local government areas
and states saying, “most states and local governments are not viable
and infect, depend on the federal government for their survival
thereby negating the principles of true Federalism”.
