Chief Nlewedim said that when the company goes into production next year, prices of the products will go down drastically because of reduced cost of production since most of the raw materials will be sourced locally, like clay for ceramics in Umuahia.

Among the items that will be produced are gold chandeliers, mirrors, fountains, gold plated switches, remote controlled dimmer switches, wall brackets, outdoor lightings, table lamps, sockets and bed lamps, all in beautiful eye-catching designs. He dismissed the probable stiffing oof the local market by large scale importation of its products saying “we are not going to produce anything below standard, So, high quality coupled with subsequent low prices will make buying the more expensive imported ones unattractive and unreasonable”. Interbond started operation in 1988 and has, within its short existence, made a mark with the introduction into the Nigerian market of good quality products which the general manager said are meant for people who appreciate beauty and who can afford to pay”.
