# Will Use My Experience and Exposure to Make Life Better For My People ~ Umuyota Eze-Elect, Sakwe

The Eze-Elect of Umuyota Autonomous Community in Umuawa-Alaocha, Ohuhu-Umuahia, Chief Sonny Nlewedim, CEO of Interbound Industries, has articulated his vision for the future of Umuyota. Embracing his new role as the Traditional Ruler, Chief Nlewedim, affectionately known as Sakwe, is determined to give back to his community and transform it for the better.

The Umuahia-born industrialist, who was unanimously elected by the kingmakers in Umuyota after a rigorous screening process, has expressed his gratitude and readiness to serve. At this stage in his life, Chief Nlewedim believes he has been blessed immensely and feels a deep sense of responsibility to return home and contribute to the welfare of his people.

Chief Nlewedim is acutely aware of the challenges his community has faced over the years, particularly due to a lack of effective leadership. As the new traditional ruler, his first priority is to unite the people of Umuyota and restore their confidence in the traditional institution. By fostering a sense of unity, he aims to lay a solid foundation for sustainable development.

With a wealth of experience and a broad network of contacts, Chief Nlewedim is well-positioned to create meaningful employment opportunities for the youth of his community. He is particularly troubled by the prevalence of poverty and criminal activities among the young population, despite the abundance of opportunities in Information Communication and Technology (ICT).

Determined to change this narrative, Sakwe plans to introduce the youth to various ICT opportunities that can help them achieve financial independence legitimately. He also has access to federal jobs, particularly within security agencies, and aims to ensure these opportunities are fully utilized by his people. Recognizing that a lack of self-confidence and fear of failure have held many back, he is committed to addressing these issues head-on now that he is fully engaged with his community.

Chief Nlewedim is resolute in his promise to elevate the standards of leadership in Umuyota. He plans to revive the morale of the youth and ensure they have access to opportunities both locally and internationally. Beyond creating opportunities, he is dedicated to the overall development of his community through partnerships with the government and relevant authorities. His goal is to attract the necessary infrastructure and social amenities that will improve the quality of life for all residents.

As a monarch, Chief Nlewedim vows to enhance the lives of his people, ensuring that Umuyota prospers under his leadership. His formal presentation to the people of the Umuyota Autonomous Community, which comprises four communities: Umuorioko, Umueke (Okpuala), Umuokarafor, and Umuakamoyewere, will take place on Monday, May 13th, 2024.

With Chief Sonny Nlewedim at the helm, the future of Umuyota looks bright. His extensive experience, passion for development, and unwavering commitment to his people promise to usher in a new era of prosperity and unity. The community eagerly anticipates the positive changes and growth that will come with his reign, confident in his ability to lead them toward a better future.
