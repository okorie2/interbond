              He is the Chief Executive Officer of Interbond Nigeria Ltd, like
              the king, who William Shakespeare in his book: “King Richard 11,”
              said all the waters in the rude rough seas could not wash off the
              anointing balm on his head. The foremost industrialist,
              entrepreneur and politician, like a colossus, bestrode Nigeria’s
              manufacturing and financial sector in the 90’s. Since then, he has
              remained one of the few leading lights in a nation that is still
              groping in the dark for competent leadership. He and a few others
              championed the manufacturing of electrical appliances and
              accessories in the Nigeria in the early 90s. Interbond, which had
              its factory located on No. 4 Nwoha Street, Osisioma, Aba, Abia
              State, was famous for manufacturing of sophisticated chandeliers
              that rivaled similar products from Europe, America as well as
              Asia.

              The astute businessman is also noted for his several interventions
              to successive administrations on how to grow the Nigerian economy.
              These interventions are mostly on correcting defective policies
              hindering the realization of the country’s industrialization
              dream. He has persistently maintained that a situation of poor
              infrastructure base, capital flight and an exchange rate that
              skews against the Naira will continue to discourage investments in
              the manufacturing sector.

              His position is that the government and managers of the economy
              must combine both local and international perspectives that will
              inject a new dynamism to help revive the nation’s economy. Chief
              Nlewedim’s experience is not limited to the business world. He has
              also had stint in the public service. He was appointed as Chairman
              of Imo State Environmental Protection Agency during the botched
              Third Republic by then Governor Evan Enwerem. As head of the
              agency, Nlewedim worked directly under the then deputy governor of
              the state, Dr. Douglas Acholonu. Ahead of the country’s return to
              civil rule in 1999, Nlewedim aspired to govern Abia State but
              later dropped his ambition following interventions by some notable
              Nigerians.
